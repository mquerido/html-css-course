# HTML and CSS Course

These are all the files that I personally made while following SuperSimpleDev's six and a half hour long HTML and CSS course.

The course consisted of 17 lessons with exercises to do separately. The final output was to create a YouTube homepage clone.

Note: Some exercises may not be available. This is due to the nature of the exercises needing to be done on the final output.
